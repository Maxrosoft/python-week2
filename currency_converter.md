# Task: Currency Converter

**Objective:** Create a program that performs currency conversion. Write a program in Python that includes the following topics:

1. Basic concepts: variables, data types, operators, input, and output.
2. Conditional statements: if, else.

**Description:**
1. Ask the user to enter an amount of money in a specific currency (dollars).

2. Offer the user to choose the target currency into which they want to convert their money (provide conversion options to euros, pounds, yens).

3. Display the conversion result on the screen.

4. Make the program interactive so that the user can perform multiple conversions without restarting the program.

**Example Output:**
```
Welcome to the Currency Converter!

Enter the amount of money: 100

Choose the target currency for conversion:
1. Euro
2. Pound
3. Yen

Choose the currency (enter the number): 2

Conversion Result:
100 dollars are equal to 73.20 pounds.

Do you want to perform another conversion? (yes/no): yes

Enter the amount of money: 50

Choose the target currency for conversion:
1. Euro
2. Pound
3. Yen

Choose the currency (enter the number): 1

Conversion Result:
50 dollars are equal to 42.90 euros.

Do you want to perform another conversion? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Currency Converter. Goodbye!
```

**Note:**
Ensure that your program handles input errors gracefully (e.g., if the user enters invalid input) and provides informative messages in such cases. Use functions to reuse code and create a clear and user-friendly program interface.
