# Task: Simple Calculator with Conditions

**Objective:** Create a simple calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input. Write a program in a programming language (e.g., Python) that includes the following topics:

1. Basic concepts: variables, data types, operators.
2. Input and output of data.
3. Basic arithmetic operations.
4. Conditional statements: if, elif, else.
5. Loops: while and for.
6. Comparison and logical operators.

**Description:**
1. Upon launching the program, display a greeting and prompt the user to enter two numbers (a and b) and the operation (+, -, *, /) they want to perform.

2. Display a menu with available operations and ask the user to choose one of them.

3. Depending on the selected operation, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation on the entered numbers.

4. Display the result on the screen.

5. After performing the operation, ask the user if they want to continue using the calculator or exit the program.

6. If the user wants to continue, go back to step 1.

**Example Output:**
```
Hello! Welcome to the calculator.

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Menu:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Choose an operation (enter the number): 3
Result: 50

Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes

Enter the first number: 15
Enter the second number: 3

Menu:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Choose an operation (enter the number): 2
Result: 12

Do you want to continue? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!
```

**Note:**
In addition to the steps described, ensure that your program handles possible input errors (e.g., if the user enters non-numeric values where numbers are expected) and provides informative messages in such situations.
