# Task: Text-Based Adventure Game "Journey to the Unknown Lands"

**Objective:** Create a text-based adventure game where the player makes decisions and explores unknown lands. Write a program in Python that includes the following topics:

1. Basic concepts: variables, data types, operators, input, and output of data.
2. Conditional statements: if, elif, else.
3. Loops: while.

**Description:**
1. Create a captivating story for the game, which sets the scene for the adventure in a mysterious and unexplored world. This could be a fantasy realm with magic, enchanted forests, or hidden caves - your imagination is the limit!

2. Write a program that displays the text-based story and prompts the player to make choices by entering specific commands or numbers.

3. Depending on the player's choices, alter the course of the story, providing various opportunities and obstacles. For example, if the player chooses to venture into the forest, they might encounter a dangerous creature, while exploring a cave might lead to the discovery of a valuable artifact.

4. Keep track of the player's progress through the lands and display their current state (health).

5. Implement conditions for both successful completion (e.g., finding the exit from the unknown lands) and failure (e.g., reaching zero health or making the wrong decision).

6. Ensure the storyline is engaging, and the player's choices have an impact on their experience and the outcome of the adventure.

**Example Output:**
